### What is Tropy?
Tropy is open-source software designed to help researchers organize and describe archival images. For a snapshot view of what's possible in Tropy, we've included a few highlights below drawn from <a href='https://docs.tropy.org/' target='_blank'>Tropy's official documentation</a>. 

We recommend consulting the documentation, along with <a href='https://forums.tropy.org/' target='_blank'>Tropy's support forum</a>, for an extensive list of what's possible and a guide to getting started.

### How can I use it?
In Tropy, you can:
- combine multiple images into a single item — for example, photographs that form part of the same letter can be combined,
- record and edit metadata information (such as author, title, archive, copyright permissions, etc.) for images
- create and apply custom tags to individual items or in bulk,
- add notes to individual images — the notes field is often a handy place to include transcriptions,
- search and filter images based on the metadata, tags, and/or notes you've added.

### What should I keep in mind when starting a new project?
As Tropy's<a href='https://docs.tropy.org/using-tropy/create_project' target='_blank'>'Create a New Project'</a> page recommends, it is best to conceive of a project at a overarching level—for example, create a project for the whole book rather than for a specific chapter. You can then use lists, tags, and notes to demarcate and work on specific sections of the larger project. The reason for this recommendation is that Tropy does not support moving photographs from one project to another project.

**One important caveat is that Tropy does not make copies of your images.** Rather, Tropy only creates a thumbnail version; the original remains on your local hard drive (or wherever you had it stored originally). Whenever you want to view that image in Tropy, the software will attempt to load the image from that original location. If you make changes to the original image, such as rotating it or moving it to a different location, you have to update the information in Tropy. To do so, click on the altered or moved image, and right click on the filename under "Photo" on the right-hand column. Select "Consolidate Photo."

### What file formats does Tropy accept?
Tropy currently works with the following file formats:
- JPG/JPEG
- PNG
- SVG
- TIFF
- GIF
- PDF
- JP2000

### How can I create a more portable version of Tropy that can be worked on with collaborators?
1. Open Tropy and create a new project in the same overarching folder that contains your images. 
2. From the top toolbar, click on "Tropy" and go to "Preferences."
3. Scroll to the bottom and select "Enable Developer Mode."
4. From the top toolbar, click on the new "Developer" option that appears and select "Rebase Project" (only click on it once!). There will be no visible change after you click to rebase the project, but it should now be shareable. 
5. Add a few images. Close the Tropy file. Let a collaborator open it from their computer and confirm that it works. If it doesn't, or for more information on what is happening behind the scenes, visit the <a href='https://forums.tropy.org/search?q=rebase' target='_blank'>Tropy support forum, searching for the word "rebase"</a>.

*This process has been tested with collaborators working from Yale Box Drive. It only works consistently if all participants access Tropy from the Box Drive folder on their local computers (i.e. not through the browser) and close Tropy when they're not using the software (this prevents conflicting copies of the file in Box).*

### How can I download Box Drive?
1. Log in to <a href='https://yale.account.box.com/login' target='_blank'>Box at Yale</a> in your browser.
2. Click your account icon in the top right corner and select "Apps," which will take you to the Applications page.
3. From the Applications page, click on "Official Box Apps" in the top right-hand column.
4. Find Box Drive and click on it. This will take you to the Box Drive page.
5. From the Box Drive page, click the download button for Mac or Windows, depending on your computer. This will download the installer.
6. Double click on the installer and click through the prompts to allow the download.
7. During the installation, you may see a security warning if you're on a Mac. If you do, open "System Preferences" on your computer and go to "Security & Privacy." Click "Allow." This will authorize the installation to finish.
8. At the end of the installation, you will be asked for your Yale email address. You will then be taken to a CAS screen for your NetID and password, followed by a Duo Authentication screen if you're off campus. But after that, the installation will be complete and a folder should be added to your Desktop with all of your Box materials.

*If you have Box Sync installed, you should receive a prompt for uninstalling it during the Box Drive instllation. If you do, click "Yes," because there are software issues with having both installed on the same computer.
